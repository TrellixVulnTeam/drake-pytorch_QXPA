# TODO:
- [x] Simplest c++ torch
- [x] Simplest c++ drake, via shambala
- [x] Simplest C++ torch and drake code run together
- [ ] Complete Eric's checklist for python
    - [x] briefly practice porting pytorch gradients to np arrays of drake autdiffxd's
    - [ ] implement a pydrake LeadSystem and get pytorch ff bits working
    - [ ] try to propagate autodiff bits in the LeafSystem.  May require dropping down into c++
